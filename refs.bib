    abstract = {Lab teams are dynamic entities in which a lot depends on the principal investigator (PI) and the framework set by them. However, within these parameters, there is a lot of room for lab members to contribute to a happy and productive environment. Often doctoral students or postdocs (or other staff) may underestimate how much of a difference they can really make. Here are 10 simple rules on how to help make a lab a better place; these rules are mostly aimed at building better lab communities, where people help each other, look out for each other, and take an interest in critically questioning the status quo.},

abstract={The prosperity and lifestyle of our society are very much governed by achievements in condensed matter physics, chemistry and materials science, because new products for sectors such as energy, the environment, health, mobility and information technology (IT) rely largely on improved or even new materials. Examples include solid-state lighting, touchscreens, batteries, implants, drug delivery and many more. The enormous amount of research data produced every day in these fields represents a gold mine of the twenty-first century. This gold mine is, however, of little value if these data are not comprehensively characterized and made available. How can we refine this feedstock; that is, turn data into knowledge and value? For this, a FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) data infrastructure is a must. Only then can data be readily shared and explored using data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) methods. Making data 'findable and AI ready' (a forward-looking interpretation of the acronym) will change the way in which science is carried out today. In this Perspective, we discuss how we can prepare to make this happen for the field of materials science.},
