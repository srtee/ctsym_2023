    abstract = {Lab teams are dynamic entities in which a lot depends on the principal investigator (PI) and the framework set by them. However, within these parameters, there is a lot of room for lab members to contribute to a happy and productive environment. Often doctoral students or postdocs (or other staff) may underestimate how much of a difference they can really make. Here are 10 simple rules on how to help make a lab a better place; these rules are mostly aimed at building better lab communities, where people help each other, look out for each other, and take an interest in critically questioning the status quo.},
