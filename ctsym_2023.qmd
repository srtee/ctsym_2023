# Introduction

## About Me

## Workshop Goals

- Define reproducible research
- Identify broad principles for reproducibility
- Find something to work on today!

## A Buffet Tasting

![](img/buffet-unsplash.jpg)

> There are many paths toward reproducible research, and you shouldn’t try to change all aspects of your current practices all at once.
> Identify one weakness, adopt an improved approach, refine that a bit, and then move on to the next thing.  [@bromanrr]{.smalltext}

> When he investigated, Chang was horrified to discover that a homemade data-analysis program had flipped two columns of data, inverting the electron-density map from which his team had derived the final protein structure. Unfortunately, his group had used the program to analyze data for other proteins. [@nightmare]{.smalltext}

>We have a habit in writing articles published in scientific journals to make the work as finished as possible, to cover all the tracks, to not worry about the blind alleys or to describe how you had the wrong idea first, and so on. So there isn’t any place to publish, in a dignified manner, what you actually did in order to get to do the work, although, there has been in these days, some interest in this kind of thing.

# Documenting and Organization

## Eight Step Filename Convention

1. What _files_ will this cover?
2. What _metadata_ am I tracking?
3. Will I _encode_ or abbreviate the metadata?
4. What _order_ should I list metadata in?
5. What _separator_ characters go between metadata?
6. Will I track different _versions_ of files?
7. Now _write down_ your naming convention pattern and some examples ...
8. ... and save it in a `README.md` in your project folder.

[[@filename8steps], CC-BY 4.0]{.smalltext}

## Eight Step Filename Convention

```markdown
_Files_: solvent trajectory DCD files
_Metadata_: potential difference, non-equilibrium force, trajectory date
_Encoding_: "V00" = 0.0 volts (2-pad), 
"F040" = 40 LAMMPS force units (3-pad), ISO8601 dates (YYYYMMDD)
_Order_ and _separator_: volts, force, date, separated with _
_Versions_: maybe during postprocessing I will combine
dated partial trajectories into a "full" trajectory?

_Final convention_:
"V"vv_"F"fff_YYYYMMDD.dcd *or* "V"vv_"F"fff_full.dcd

_Examples_:
V00_F040_20230415.dcd
(0.0 V, force 40 LAMMPS units, date 2023-04-15)
V25_F100_full.dcd
(2.5 V, force 100 LAMMPS units, combined from over multiple dates)
```

## Three Principles for (File) Names {auto-animate="true"}

- Machine readable
  - "glob-friendly" using delimiters, splitting filenames auto-returns metadata
- Human readable
  - make a "slug" -- two or three word description of file content
  - alternate dashes and underscores: `fig01_intro-pic.png`, `fig02_charge-vs-v.png`
- Sorts well
  - Order metadata from most to least important
  - Pad numbers and use YYYY-MM-DD dates (ISO 8601)

## Directory Structures

## Using Notebooks

# Automate 

## Automating single steps



# Template-y stuff {visibility=hidden}
## Software Requirements

- Start by downloading [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).
  - Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system developed by Posit (formerly RStudio)
    focused on enabling dynamic content (such as Python notebooks)
    and generating multiple outputs sensibly from a single Markdown source.
- Install it and run through the online tutorial.
- Then start creating your own presentation from the `srtee/RevealUQ` template!

## Overall description

Since the template is coded in Markdown it is extremely simple.

With the right Quarto presets it could be extended to many other formats.

Lorem Ipsum et cetera paribus undeam magnatus.

# Features

## Columns and Boxes

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
A wide column

::: {.column width="30%"}
A narrower column

::: {.column width="20%"}
A narrowest column

## Beautiful Math

In Euclidean space, it can be shown that the Christoffel symbols of the second kind are equivalent to:

$${\Gamma^k}_{ij} = \frac{\partial {\bf{e}}_i}{\partial x^j} \cdot {\bf{e}}^k = \frac{\partial \bf{e}_i}{\partial x^j} \cdot g^{km} {\bf{e}}_m .$$

Christoffel symbols of the first kind can then be found via index lowering:

::: {.hidden}
$$
 \def\gmk{g_{mk}}
 \def\bolde#1#2{{{{\bf{e}}_{#1}}^{#2}}}
$$
:::

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Gamma_{kij} &= \Gamma^m_{ij}\gmk \\
&= \frac{\partial \bolde{i}{}}{\partial x^j} \cdot \bolde{}{m} \gmk \\
&= \frac{\partial \bolde{i}{}}{\partial x^j} \cdot \bolde{k}{}.
\end{aligned}
$$

which also provides a neat place to hide $\LaTeX$ macros.

## Lists

- These items
- are not numbered
- and neither should your happy moments be.

1. These items
2. Are numbered
3. As may the sources of your worries be.


## Pictures and Citations

# Mindset

## Try changing things!

> It is as simple as not taking for granted how things are currently, and asking how they can be better.

- See something annoying / missing? Ask how you might fix it.
- Little improvements matter -- they build up over time.
- Keep your PI in the loop -- some things _can't_ be changed.

::: {.r-frame}
- Time cost: low to medium
- Benefit: feeling "ownership"!
:::

## Be open

> If you are open to new things, new opportunities might also open up to you, and you contribute actively to a very positive aspect of lab culture that cannot be prescribed.

- Have you seen something elsewhere? Why not try it here?
- Hear out your lab-mates when their viewpoints or experiences differ from yours.

::: {.r-frame}
- Time cost: low to medium
- Benefit: new insights and opportunities
